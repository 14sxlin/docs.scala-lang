This “Taste of Scala” chapter provides a whirlwind tour of the main features of the Scala 3 programming language. After the initial tour in this chapter, the rest of the book provides more details on these features, and the [Reference documentation][reference] provides _many_ more details.

>Throughout this book, you’ll be able to test many of the examples directly on this page. In addition to that, you can also test anything you’d like on [ScalaFiddle.io](https://scalafiddle.io), [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org), or in the Scala REPL, which is demonstrated shortly.
