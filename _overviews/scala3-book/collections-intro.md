This chapter introduces the most common Scala 3 collections and their accompanying methods. Scala comes with a wealth of collections classes, but you can go a long way by starting with just a few classes, and later using the others as needed. Similarly, each class has dozens of functional methods to make your life easier, but you can achieve a lot by starting with just a handful of them.

Therefore, this section introduces and demonstrates the most common classes and methods that youâ€™ll need to get started. When you need to understand more classes or more methods, see the Reference documentation for all the details.
