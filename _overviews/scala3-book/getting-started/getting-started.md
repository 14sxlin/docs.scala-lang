title: Getting Started with Scala 3
description: This page describes how to get started with Scala 3.
---


Welcome. This page helps you get started with Scala 3.

Depending on your needs, there are two main ways to get started:

- If you want to start experimenting with Scala as fast as possible, [click here to start using the Scastie website](gs-scala-in-browser.md) as an online “Scala playground environment.”
- If you want to develop applications on your computer, you’ll need to [install Java and sbt on your computer](gs-just-sbt-java.md). Once you have those tools installed, you can [run the “Hello, world” examples](gs-hello-world-examples.md)

Just follow those links for step-by-step details on each process.

Also, when you’re ready to develop applications you’ll probably also want to use an IDE. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) both work well with Scala 3.
