## Welcome to the Scala 3 Overview

Welcome to the _Overview_ documentation for Scala 3. The goal of this documentation is to provide an informal introduction to the Scala language. It touches on all Scala topics, but as its name implies, generally just provides an overview of each feature. If at any time while you’re reading the Overview and you want more information on a specific feature, you’ll find links to our _Reference_ documentation, which covers all of the language features in detail.

Our hope in these pages is to demonstrate that Scala is a beautiful, expressive programming language, with a clean, modern syntax, and supports functional programming (FP), object-oriented programming (OOP), and a fusion of FP and OOP in a typed setting. Scala’s syntax, grammar, and features have been re-thought, debated in an open process, and updated in 2020 to be more clear and easier to understand than ever before.

The Overview begins with a whirlwind tour of many of Scala’s features in the “A Taste of Scala” section. After that tour, the sections that follow it provide more details on those language features.
